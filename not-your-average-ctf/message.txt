Listen up kid,  

 
You've been tapped for a job, and we're not here to hold your hand through it. Your mission: Get into E Corp's system through their lackey, Tyrell Wellick.  

  
This guy's got the goods, and we need in. You better get your head in the game and use those details we gave you to make a damn good attack plan. This ain't your grandma's hacking challenge; we need results, and we need them fast.  

  
Make a custom wordlist, break into E Corp's portal, and snatch Tyrell's password. No excuses, no screw-ups. We don't have time for your amateur mistakes.  

This ain't no picnic, so don't expect any hand-holding. Fail, and you'll wish you never even heard of us.  

  
Now get moving,
