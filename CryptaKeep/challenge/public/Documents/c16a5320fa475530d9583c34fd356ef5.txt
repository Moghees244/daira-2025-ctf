Mission Briefing:
Agent Codename: ServiceSatisfactionSurveyor
Mission Objective: Create a comprehensive customer satisfaction survey for a service-based business, gathering feedback, insights, and actionable data to assess service quality, identify areas for improvement, and enhance customer experience.
Mission Details:

Survey Objectives: Define the objectives and goals of the customer satisfaction survey, such as measuring overall satisfaction, assessing specific service aspects, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and capturing suggestions for improvement. Ensure alignment with the business's service standards and customer experience priorities.
Survey Structure: Design the survey structure and format, incorporating a mix of closed-ended and open-ended questions to gather quantitative and qualitative feedback from customers. Organize questions logically, starting with general satisfaction inquiries before delving into specific service aspects and experiences.
Satisfaction Metrics: Develop rating scales or Likert-type scales to measure customer satisfaction levels across different dimensions, such as service quality, responsiveness, professionalism, communication, timeliness, and problem resolution. Use clear and consistent language to facilitate respondents' understanding and response accuracy.
Service Attributes: Include questions that assess various service attributes and touchpoints relevant to the business, such as the ease of booking appointments, the friendliness of staff, the quality of service delivery, the accuracy of information provided, and the overall value for money.
Net Promoter Score (NPS): Incorporate the Net Promoter Score (NPS) methodology into the survey to assess customer loyalty and likelihood to recommend the business to others. Include the standard NPS question ("How likely are you to recommend our service to a friend or colleague?") along with an optional open-ended follow-up question.
Open-Ended Questions: Include open-ended questions to capture qualitative feedback, suggestions, and comments from customers. Encourage respondents to provide detailed explanations, examples, and insights into their experiences, preferences, and areas of satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
Survey Length: Keep the survey concise and focused to minimize respondent fatigue and maximize completion rates. Aim for a balanced mix of essential questions that provide meaningful insights without overwhelming respondents with excessive or repetitive inquiries.
Survey Delivery: Determine the most effective delivery method for distributing the customer satisfaction survey to customers, such as email, SMS, website pop-up, mobile app notification, or in-person handouts. Consider timing, frequency, and accessibility to maximize response rates and engagement.
Data Collection and Analysis: Establish protocols and systems for collecting survey responses securely and efficiently. Analyze survey data using statistical methods, qualitative analysis techniques, and data visualization tools to extract actionable insights and trends.
Action Planning: Develop an action plan based on survey findings, prioritizing areas for improvement, setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals, and assigning responsibility for implementing corrective actions. Communicate survey results and improvement initiatives to relevant stakeholders.
