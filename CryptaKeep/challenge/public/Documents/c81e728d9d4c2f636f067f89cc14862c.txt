Ensure data integrity, accuracy, and completeness for reliable analysis.
Conversion Funnel Analysis: Evaluate the conversion funnel, from initial website visit to desired actions or conversions, to identify potential bottlenecks, drop-off points, and areas for optimization.

User Behavior Analysis: Explore user behavior patterns and interactions on the website, including navigation paths, page views, session duration, scroll depth, clicks, and form submissions. Identify common user journeys, popular content, and friction points that may impact conversion rates and user satisfaction.
Traffic Source Analysis: Examine the sources of website traffic, including organic search, paid search, direct traffic, referral traffic, social media, email campaigns, and advertising channels. Assess the quality, relevance, and effectiveness of each traffic source in driving conversions and engagement.

Analyze conversion rates, engagement metrics, and user preferences within each segment to tailor marketing strategies and content accordingly.
A/B Testing and Experimentation: Design and implement A/B tests or multivariate tests to evaluate the impact of website changes, variations, or optimizations on conversion rates and user engagement. Test different elements such as headlines, calls-to-action, layout, design, pricing, and messaging to identify winning variations.
